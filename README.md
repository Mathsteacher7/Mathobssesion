## Project Brief and Technical Requirements

* **Build a full-stack application** by making our own back and front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve our data from a Postgres database
* **Consume our API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.

### Approach Taken

#### Planning 

* **Team communication and ways of working** - We spent the first day agreeing how we would work together, keep each other informed of progress and ultimately create a consistent code. We used Trello to break down the project and keep track of progress. We also spent a few minutes every morning reviewing what we achieved the day before and what we would work towards that day. 

* **User Stories/Wireframes** - We discussed the user journey we hoped to offer and created wireframes accordanly. We drafted the following pages:
* Home
* All Subjects list
* All Exercises with filter
* Exercises per Subject  
* Add Exercise
* Login
* Register
* Profile
* Profile Edit
 
##### Example:

* **Database Relationships** - Database relationships, as shown below. The MVP consisted of User, Exercise and Subject. Comments and Sub-subjects were extra features should time allowed.

* **Project set-up** - Created a repository on GitHub, ensured both computers were Git ready, and we also created a development branch. We also installed the different packages necessary to start the project - e.g. Django, PIPENV and more.
